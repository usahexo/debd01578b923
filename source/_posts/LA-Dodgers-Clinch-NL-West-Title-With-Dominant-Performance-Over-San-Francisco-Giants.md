#  Kenta Maeda Pitches Gem As Dodgers Rout Giants, 10-2

The Los Angeles Dodgers welcomed the San Francisco Giants to town on Tuesday night, and Kenta Maeda was absolutely dealing. The Giants just didn't have an answer for him.

Maeda pitched seven shutout innings, allowing just three hits and striking out nine batters. Not a bad way to ring in your 28th birthday.

"Kenta was fantastic tonight," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. "He had all of his pitches working, he was executing them and he had good tempo."

The Dodgers offense did its part as well, scoring 10 runs on 16 hits. Justin Turner led the way with three hits, including a home run, while Cody Bellinger and Joc Pederson both added two RBIs.

With the win, the Dodgers moved into first place in the National League West, one game ahead of the Colorado Rockies. They'll look to stay there with another win against the Giants on Wednesday night.

#  Justin Turner Hits Two Homers In Dodgers Route Of Giants

Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner hit two home runs Wednesday night against the San Francisco Giants. The first was a solo shot in the fifth inning and the second was a three-run homer in the seventh inning. This helped propel the Dodgers to an easy 10-2 victory.

Turner now has 18 homers this season, which leads the team. He is also batting .321, which is currently third best in the National League. Turner’s hot bat has been instrumental in the Dodgers recent success, as they have now won six of their last seven games.

“I’ve been feeling pretty good lately,” Turner said after Wednesday night’s game. “The biggest thing for me right now is just trying to get on base and let the big guys behind me do their thing.”

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts agrees that Turner is playing extremely well right now.

“He’s been really good all year long and he’s carrying us right now,” Roberts said.

The Dodgers will need Turner to keep swinging a hot bat if they want to make a deep playoff run this season. They are currently in first place in the National League West division, but there is still a lot of baseball left to be played.

Cody Bellinger had himself a game on Wednesday night against the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers young slugger went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles and two RBIs in LA’s 14-2 thrashing of their NL West rivals.

Bellinger has now hit safely in six of his last seven games, raising his batting average from .284 to .311 in that span. The 22-year-old is quickly establishing himself as one of the premier hitters in all of baseball and could very well be in for a monster season.

The Dodgers offense was clicking on all cylinders against the Giants, pounding out 16 hits overall. Max Muncy, Yasiel Puig, Joc Pederson and Enrique Hernandez also drove in runs for LA.

Dodgers starter Rich Hill pitched six innings of one-run ball, striking out seven while only allowing three hits. This was a much needed bounce back outing for Hill, who had allowed 11 runs over his previous 9 2/3 innings pitched.

With the win, the Dodgers move to within 1 1/2 games of the first place Giants in the NL West standings. They’ll look to keep the pressure on their rivals with another win on Thursday night behind ace Clayton Kershaw.
