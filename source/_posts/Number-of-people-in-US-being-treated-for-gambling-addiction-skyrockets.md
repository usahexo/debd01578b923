#  Number of people in US being treated for gambling addiction skyrockets

The number of people in the US being treated for gambling addiction has skyrocketed in recent years, according to data from the National Institute on Gambling Disorders (NIGD), with millions of people now believed to be affected.

Gambling addiction is a serious mental health disorder that can have devastating effects on both the individual and their loved ones. Symptoms can include excessive spending on gambling, lying about gambling activities, chasing losses, and feeling overwhelmed or unable to stop gambling.

The NIGD’s latest report shows that the number of people seeking treatment for gambling addiction has more than doubled since 2005, with an estimated 2-3 million Americans now affected. This includes both those who have formally been diagnosed with a gambling disorder and those who may be struggling with problem gambling behaviors but have not yet sought help.

“These numbers are startling but not really surprising,” said Dr. Timothy Fong, a professor of psychiatry at UCLA and co-director of the UCLA Gambling Studies Program. “With legalized gambling available in more and more states, along with ever-more aggressive marketing by casinos and other gaming establishments, it’s no wonder we’re seeing an increase in problem gambling.”

Problem gambling can have a serious impact on individuals and families, leading to financial ruin, job loss, relationship problems, and even suicide. But there is hope: treatment for gambling addiction is available and can be very effective if properly implemented.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help as soon as possible. There are many resources available, including local support groups, counseling centers, and treatment programs.

#  Gamblers turn to casinos online to feed addiction

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that affects many people in different ways. Some may turn to casinos online in an effort to feed their addiction, while others may try to stay away from all forms of gambling. No matter which path you take, it is important to understand the signs and symptoms of gambling addiction and how to get help if you need it.

There are many different signs and symptoms of gambling addiction. Some people may become obsessed with gambling and start to gamble more and more often. Others may begin to lie about how much they are gambling or how much money they have lost. Some people may even start to steal money or sell personal belongings in order to finance their gambling habit.

If you are worried that you or someone you know might be struggling with a gambling addiction, there are steps you can take to get help. The first step is to talk to someone about your concerns. You can talk to a friend, family member, or therapist about your addiction and ask for their help. You can also call a helpline such as Gamblers Anonymous for support.

#  Gambling addiction growing among women and seniors

In the United States, gambling addiction is a problem that is growing among women and seniors. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), in 2014 problem gambling rates among women were 1.3 percent, and by 2018, that rate had increased to 2 percent. For seniors, the problem gambling rate was 2.9 percent in 2014, and it grew to 3.6 percent by 2018.

These increases are significant because they mean that more people are suffering from the negative consequences of gambling addiction, including financial ruin, relationship problems, and even suicide. The NCPG warns that the problem is only going to get worse as more states legalize online gambling.

What is causing this increase in gambling addiction? There are several factors at work here. First, there has been a relaxation of social norms around gambling in recent years. With more states legalizing various forms of gambling, such as casino games, sports betting, and lotteries, it has become increasingly normalized to gamble.

Second, there has been a proliferation of electronic gaming machines (EGMs) in casinos and other locations. These machines are designed to be addictive and are incredibly lucrative for casinos. They have been shown to hook players into risking ever-larger sums of money with little chance of winning anything back.

Last but not least, many people see gambling as a way to make fast money. The allure of easy riches can be irresistible for some people who are struggling financially or who are dealing with other personal problems. Gambling can seem like a quick fix for these individuals, but it actually only makes things worse in the long run.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to get help right away. There are many resources available for people who want to overcome their addiction, including counseling, therapy groups, and self-help programs such as Gamblers Anonymous (GA). Don't let yourself or someone else get trapped in the cycle of gambling addiction - get help today!

#  Nevada leads the nation in gambling addictions

Nevada is known for its gambling addiction problems. The state has more problem gamblers than any other in the nation. In fact, one in four Nevadans has a gambling problem.

The high number of problem gamblers is due, in part, to the casinos that are found in almost every town in Nevada. There are also numerous racetracks and poker rooms throughout the state. Gambling is a big part of the culture in Nevada and it's easy to get caught up in it.

The effects of gambling addiction can be devastating. It can ruin families and relationships, lead to job losses and financial problems, and even cause health problems. The best way to avoid these problems is to not gamble at all.

If you or someone you know has a gambling addiction, there is help available. There are numerous rehab centers throughout the state that can help you get your life back on track.

#  Treatment centers struggle to keep up with demand for help with gambling addiction

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that is on the rise in the United States. While there are treatment centers that offer help for those who are addicted to gambling, these centers are struggling to keep up with the demand for services.

According to a report from The Associated Press, the number of people seeking treatment for gambling addiction has increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade. This is due in part to the increasing popularity of electronic gaming devices and sports betting.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their families. Those who are addicted to gambling may lose large sums of money, which can lead to financial problems. They may also become isolated from friends and family members, and may even develop mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.

The good news is that there are treatment centers available that can help those who are addicted to gambling. These centers offer a variety of services, including counseling and therapy, as well as support groups for those who are struggling with this addiction.

However, these centers are struggling to keep up with the increasing demand for services. This is due in part to the fact that gambling addiction is not yet recognized as an official mental health disorder by the American Psychiatric Association (APA).

This lack of recognition means that insurance companies often do not cover treatment for gambling addiction. As a result, many people who need help cannot afford to get it.

One way to address this issue is for the APA to recognize gambling addiction as an official mental health disorder. This would help to ensure that those who need help would be able to receive it without having to worry about whether or not their insurance will cover it.

It is also important for people who are struggling with gambling addiction to seek help sooner rather than later. The longer they wait, the harder it will be to overcome this addiction.
