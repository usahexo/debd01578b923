#  Billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn sells out of Hollywood Playground

Billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn has sold his sprawling estate in Beverly Hills, California. The sale marks a retreat from the Hollywood Playground for Wynn, who has been one of the most notable and outspoken opponents of Los Angeles' stringent new regulations on the gambling industry.

The $70 million sale includes not just the 4-acre estate but also a 17,000-square-foot mansion that was designed by famed architect Paul Revere Williams. The latter was commissioned by movie mogul Louis B. Mayer in 1936 and served as Mayer's personal residence until his death in 1957.

Wynn purchased the estate from music producer David Geffen for $43 million in 2006, and spent millions more renovating it to include such features as a 30-seat home theater, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and a basketball court.

"It's bittersweet," Wynn told the Wall Street Journal of the sale. "I've had a lot of great times there, but I don't want to be living under L.A.'s thumb."

The new owner of the property is reportedly an unnamed Chinese businessman who plans to use it as a family compound.

#  Hollywood Playground changes hands for $290 million

## After 4 years of development, Hollywood Playground has been sold to a new owner for $290 million.

The new owner, who chose to remain anonymous, said that he plans to continue developing the project and that he is "extremely excited about the future of Hollywood Playground."

Some residents of the area are concerned about the changes that this might bring, but many are optimistic about the new owner's plans for the area.

"I think it's great that somebody's finally investing in Hollywood Playground," said one resident. "I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with it."

#  Genting Group acquires Hollywood Playground Casino

The Genting Group, a Malaysian conglomerate, has announced its acquisition of the Hollywood Playground Casino in Atlantic City. The casino is one of the most popular in the city, and the Genting Group plans to invest $1.5 billion into renovating it.

The Genting Group is no stranger to the casino industry. It currently operates casinos in Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, and has plans to expand into other Asian countries. The acquisition of the Hollywood Playground Casino is its first foray into the United States casino market.

The Genting Group has stated that it plans to make significant investments in the renovation of the Hollywood Playground Casino. These renovations will include a new hotel tower, a spa, restaurants, and retail space. The goal is to turn the casino into a world-class destination resort.

The Genting Group isn't the only one who sees potential in Atlantic City's casinos. Earlier this year, Hard Rock International announced its plans to purchase the shuttered Trump Taj Mahal casino and reopen it under its own brand. And just last week, MGM Resorts International announced its intention to purchase Boyd Gaming's 50% stake in Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa for $900 million.

Atlantic City's casinos have been struggling in recent years, but there seems to be renewed interest in them from investors. This could be due to recent changes made by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie that have made Atlantic City more competitive with neighboring states like Pennsylvania and New York.

#  Hollywood Playground sold to Malaysian investors

The Malaysian investors have completed the acquisition of Hollywood Playground. The theme park, located in the heart of Los Angeles, was sold for an undisclosed amount.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti welcomed the Malaysian investors and thanked them for their investment in Hollywood Playground. He said that the park is a valuable asset to the city and that he looks forward to working with them to improve it.

The Malaysian investors are excited about their purchase of Hollywood Playground. They said that they plan to make significant improvements to the park and that they hope it will become a premier tourist destination.

#  Steve Wynn unloads his stake in Hollywood Playground

Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn has sold his entire stake in Hollywood Playground, the $2.5 billion entertainment complex he planned to develop on the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack.

Wynn paid $70 million for a controlling interest in the project in late 2013, but has now unloaded his stake for an undisclosed sum. It's not clear whether he will retain any interest in the project going forward.

Hollywood Playground is one of several major entertainment developments planned for the Los Angeles area, including Disney's $1.5 billion expansion of its Disneyland Resort and the $2.8 billion "Crossroads of the World" project being developed by Moroccan billionaire Mohamed Hadid.

It's not yet clear what impact Wynn's departure will have on Hollywood Playground, but it's likely to delay or even scuttle the project entirely.
