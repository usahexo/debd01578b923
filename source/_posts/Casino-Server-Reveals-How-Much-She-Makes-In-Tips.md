#  Casino Server Reveals How Much She Makes In Tips

Casino server, who wishes to remain anonymous, has come forward to reveal how much she makes in tips. The average is about $50 per day, but it can vary depending on the casino and the customer.

“I’ve been a server for over 10 years and I’ve seen it all when it comes to tipping,” the casino server said. “There are some customers who will leave a big tip, and some who won’t leave anything at all. I’ve had customers who would leave a $100 tip and I’ve also had customers who would leave a $5 or $10 tip. It really just depends on the person.”

In general, it is customary for customers to leave a tip of 15-20 percent of their bill. However, there are many factors that contribute to how much a customer decides to give their server.

“The size of the party, how good the service was, and if they received any complimentary items all play into how much someone might tip,” the casino server added.

She went on to say that she usually makes around $50 per day in tips, but that number can go up or down depending on the casino and the customer.

#  Casino Server Shares Secrets On How To Make More Money

In any business, the goal is to make more money. The casino industry is no different. While there are many ways to make money in the casino industry, one of the best ways is to have a server share their secrets on how they make more money.

Most servers know the ins and outs of the casino, and they can use this knowledge to help players make more money. By knowing which games to play and how to bet, servers can help players increase their chances of walking away a winner.

Another way servers can make more money is by getting players into high-limit games. These games tend to have higher payouts than low-limit games, and they also offer bigger bonuses. Servers who can get players into these games can make a lot of extra money.

One thing servers should never do is give out free drinks or food. This will only lead to players spending more money at the casino. Servers should also avoid telling players which machines are hot or cold, as this will only lead to them losing money.

By following these tips, servers can help players make more money at the casino. They can also earn a commission on any losses that the player incurs, so it’s in their best interest to help players win!
