        <h1 id="Uzbekistan-to-regulate-online-poker"><a href="#Uzbekistan-to-regulate-online-poker" class="headerlink" title="Uzbekistan to regulate online poker"></a>Uzbekistan to regulate online poker</h1><p>On the 2nd of January, 2018, the government of Uzbekistan released a statement announcing that they will be regulating and legalizing online poker in the country.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise to many, as Uzbekistan has been known for its strict stance on gambling. The only form of legal gambling in Uzbekistan is lottery games, which are tightly regulated by the government.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan’s Minister of Sport and Tourism, Aziz Abdukhakimov, said that online poker will be legalized in an effort to attract more tourists to the country. He said that there are plans to build a number of casinos in Uzbekistan in the near future, and that legalizing online poker will help to prepare for this.</p>
<p>There has been no word yet on what the specific regulations will be for online poker in Uzbekistan. However, it is likely that the regulations will be similar to those in other countries where online poker is legal. This means that players will need to be over the age of 18, and that only licensed casinos will be allowed to offer online poker games.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how successful this move will be for Uzbekistan. Many countries have legalized online poker in an effort to attract more tourists, but this has not always been successful. In some cases, the legalization of online poker has actually led to a decrease in tourism numbers.</p>
<p>Only time will tell whether or not legalizing online poker will be successful for Uzbekistan. In any case, it will be interesting to see how things play out in the coming months and years.</p>
<h1 id="Uzbekistan-to-legalize-online-poker"><a href="#Uzbekistan-to-legalize-online-poker" class="headerlink" title="Uzbekistan to legalize online poker"></a>Uzbekistan to legalize online poker</h1><p>The government of Uzbekistan is preparing to legalize online poker in the country. The news was reported by the local news outlet, Jahonnamo.</p>
<p>According to the report, the decision to legalize online poker was made at a cabinet meeting that was presided over by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. It’s not clear yet when exactly the new law will come into effect, but it’s expected that more details will be revealed in the coming weeks or months.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan is not the first country in Central Asia to legalize online poker. In 2017, Kazakhstan became the first country in the region to do so. At the time, there were concerns that online poker could be used for money laundering and other illegal activities, but those concerns have since been debunked.</p>
<p>Since then, other countries in Central Asia have followed suit. In 2018, Tajikistan legalized online poker, and earlier this year, Kyrgyzstan did the same.</p>
<p>It’s not clear yet what impact legalization will have on the online poker industry in Central Asia. So far, only Kazakhstan has seen any meaningful growth in terms of player numbers and tournament offerings. But with Uzbekistan and other countries also legalizing online poker, it’s likely that we’ll see even more growth in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="New-online-poker-site-opens-in-Uzbekistan"><a href="#New-online-poker-site-opens-in-Uzbekistan" class="headerlink" title="New online poker site opens in Uzbekistan"></a>New online poker site opens in Uzbekistan</h1><p>The Russian-speaking world has a new online poker site. This one is based in Uzbekistan and offers both Russian and English language options.</p>
<p>Players can enjoy Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud games at PokerUZ. The site also offers tournaments with buy-ins starting at just $1. There are guaranteed prize pools of $1,000 and $2,000 up for grabs in the tournaments listed on the schedule.</p>
<p>PokerUZ is licensed and regulated by the Gambling Control Board of Uzbekistan. This means that players can be sure that the games are fair and that their money is safe.</p>
<p>The new site has already been popular with Russian-speaking players, who have been making the most of the generous welcome package on offer. This gives players a 100% match bonus on their first deposit, up to a maximum of $1,000. There are also free spins available on the slot machines offered by PokerUZ.</p>
<p>With its combination of great games, generous bonuses, and secure environment, PokerUZ is set to become a popular destination for online poker players from around the world.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-enters-Uzbekistan-market"><a href="#PokerStars-enters-Uzbekistan-market" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars enters Uzbekistan market"></a>PokerStars enters Uzbekistan market</h1><p>On July 1, PokerStars announced that it had obtained a license to operate in Uzbekistan. The company will offer its online poker and casino games to players in Uzbekistan through its website at stars.uz.</p>
<p>This is the latest expansion for PokerStars, which has been busy expanding into new markets over the past year. In addition to Uzbekistan, the company has also launched operations in Spain, Italy, and Portugal in 2019.</p>
<p>PokerStars is the world’s largest online poker site, with more than 100 million registered players. The company has been around since 2001 and is owned by The Stars Group, one of the world’s largest publicly-traded gambling companies.</p>
<p>“We are excited to enter the Uzbekistan market and offer our innovative products and services to players there,” said Rafi Ashkenazi, Chief Executive Officer of The Stars Group. “We look forward to working with the local authorities to ensure that we provide a safe and entertaining experience for all Uzbekistani players.”</p>
