#  What is Puppy Payday?

Puppy payday is a system that allows you to pay your dog's veterinarian bills with ease. It was created in order to help people who may not have the money to pay for their dog's vet bills outright. This system allows you to make monthly payments on your vet bill until it is paid off.

This system is beneficial for both the pet owner and the veterinarian. The pet owner can rest assured knowing that they can always get the care their pet needs, and the veterinarian can be assured of regular payments, which helps them keep their business running smoothly.

There are a few things you need to keep in mind if you want to use Puppy Payday:

-You must be a resident of the United States.
-Your dog must be insured through Trupanion.
-The total amount of your vet bill must be over $100.
-Your bill cannot be more than $5,000.

If you meet all of these requirements, Puppy Payday may be a great option for you! To learn more or sign up, visit trupanion.com/puppypayday.
