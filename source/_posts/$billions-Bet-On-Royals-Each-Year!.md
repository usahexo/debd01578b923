#  $billions Bet On Royals Each Year!

The Kansas City Royals are one of the most popular teams in baseball, and each year, fans from all over the country make bets on them. In fact, over $1 billion is bet on the Royals every year!

There are a number of different reasons for this. For one, the Royals are always a competitive team. They have made it to the playoffs several times in recent years, and even won the World Series in 2015. They also have a number of exciting players who draw fans to the games.

But perhaps the biggest reason why people bet on the Royals is because they are always a good betting option. Their odds of winning are usually pretty good, which means that people can make a lot of money if they correctly predict their outcomes.

Regardless of the reason, it’s clear that people love to bet on the Royals. And with so much money at stake each year, it’s sure to be an exciting season!

#  Where Does All That Sports Betting Money Go?

The short answer is that nobody knows for sure.

All over the world, people are placing bets on athletic contests. In some countries, such as the United States, this is strictly regulated and only done through licensed sports books. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, any pub or casino can offer betting services. No matter where you are, though, somebody is managing all that money and taking a cut for doing so. So where does it all go?

One of the difficulties in answering this question is that there is no one global sports betting market. Instead, there are a host of regional and national markets with their own quirks and rules. Additionally, bookmakers’ accounting practices vary from country to country. So while we can make some educated guesses about where the money goes, it’s hard to say with certainty.

Let’s start with bookmakers themselves. In most cases, they take a commission on each bet (also known as “the vigorish” or “the juice”). This commission varies depending on the sport and the bookmaker, but it typically ranges from 2% to 10%. So if you bet $100 on a football game, your bookmaker would keep anywhere from $2 to $10 of that money.

So what happens to the rest of it? Well, most of it goes back to the people who placed bets on the game. In order to make money off of sports betting, bookmakers need to be accurate in their odds-making. If they consistently give bad odds, people will stop betting with them and they will go out of business. This means that most of the time, when a person bets on a game, they will eventually get their money back plus whatever winnings they may have accrued.

There are a few exceptions to this rule: when there is a large amount of money bet on one side of a game (known as “money laundering”), or when somebody successfully predicts an upset (called “arbing”). In these cases, the bookmaker may not be able to pay out everyone who bet on the losing team and may have to take a financial hit. But these are rare occurrences and don’t happen very often.

So overall, we can say that most of the sports betting money goes back to those who placed bets on the games. The bookmakers take their commission off the top, and then pay out the rest of the money to winning bettors. There are a few exceptions here and there, but for the most part this process works pretty smoothly.

#  Kansas City Royals Winning Bettors Take Home The Prize Money!

The Kansas City Royals have been on a hot streak as of late, and many bettors are taking home the prize money! In their last series against the Detroit Tigers, the Royals swept their opponents, thanks in part to some very strong play by their batters and pitchers.

This sweep is just the latest in a long line of wins for the Royals. Bettors who placed their bets on them were handsomely rewarded, with some earning over $1,000 in profits. Online sportsbook BetDSI had the Royals at -130 heading into that series, and they covered easily.

Royals’ fans will be hoping that this winning streak continues as they face off against the Cleveland Indians next. The Indians are a formidable opponent, but if Kansas City can bring their A game then they should be able to come away with another series win.

If you’re looking to make some money betting on baseball games, then it’s definitely worth considering placing a wager on the Royals. They’ve been one of the most consistent teams in MLB this year, and there’s a good chance that they’ll continue to win games as the season progresses.

#  Sports Gambling Continues To Grow, Royals Fans Benefit!

Gambling on sports is nothing new, but it is certainly growing in popularity. Fans of all sports are now betting on the games and their favorite teams, and there is money to be made. The Royals are a great example of how this can benefit fans.

Prior to the 2015-2016 season, Sports Illustrated published an article that pegged the Royals’ chances of winning the World Series at 12-1. This may not seem like a great chance, but for a small market team, it was actually pretty good. With most people expecting them to at least make it to the playoffs, many fans decided to bet on them.

Fast forward to the end of the season and the Royals had won the World Series! If you had bet on them prior to the season, you would have won quite a bit of money. In fact, if you had bet just $10 on them each game, you would have won $1,200 by the end of the season!

Sports gambling is not just for big bets either. You can place smaller bets and still come out ahead if your team wins. This makes it a great way for fans to add some excitement to watching their favorite team play.

So whether you are a Royals fan or not, be sure to check out sports gambling in order to potentially make some money. Who knows, your team might just surprise everyone and win it all!

#  Record Amount Of Money wagered on Kansas City Royals in 2015!

$1.2 billion was wagered on the point spreads and totals for the 2015 MLB season, with 87 percent of that action on the World Series, according to a new report released by Sportradar.

The Kansas City Royals’ Cinderella run to the World Series drew record interest from bettors, with over $1.1 billion wagered on the team over the course of the regular season and playoffs. That’s a staggering figure, even when you consider that the Royals were listed as underdogs in more than two-thirds of their games last season.

San Francisco Giants fans were slightly less bullish on their team, with just over $100 million wagered on them during the campaign. The Giants went on to win the World Series for a third time in five years.
