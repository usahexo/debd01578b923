#  Find out the best poker hands 888 Casino and how to play them!

If you're looking to enjoy some poker action, then 888 Casino is the place to be. Here, we'll take you through the best poker hands and how to play them.

One of the most important things to remember when playing poker is that you should never play any hand unless it has a reasonable chance of winning. With this in mind, let's take a look at the best possible hands in poker.

1. Royal Flush: This is the best possible hand in poker and consists of an ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit. To win with a royal flush, you'll need to have placed a bet before the flop, and your opponent will also need to have failed to hit a better hand.

2. Straight Flush: This is a hand that consists of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. Again, you'll need to have placed a bet before the flop for this one to be valid.

3. Four of a Kind: This hand consists of four cards of the same rank, plus another card known as the kicker. As with royal flushes and straight flushes, you'll need to have placed a bet before the flop for this one to be valid.

4. Full House: This hand is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. A full house is often referred to as a 'boat'.

5. Flush: A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit, but not necessarily in consecutive order.

6. Straight: A straight is made up of five consecutive cards not all of the same suit. Straights can be formed with either high or low cards, but the highest straight will always beat the lowest straight.

7. Three Of A Kind: This hand is made up three cards of one rank and two unrelated side cards. As with other strong hands, three of a kind requires that you've placed a bet before the flop in order for it to be valid.
