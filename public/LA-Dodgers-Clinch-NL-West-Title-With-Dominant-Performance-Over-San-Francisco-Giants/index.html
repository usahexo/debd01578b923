        <h1 id="LA-Dodgers-Clinch-NL-West-Title-With-Dominant-Performance-Over-San-Francisco-Giants"><a href="#LA-Dodgers-Clinch-NL-West-Title-With-Dominant-Performance-Over-San-Francisco-Giants" class="headerlink" title="LA Dodgers Clinch NL West Title With Dominant Performance Over San Francisco Giants"></a>LA Dodgers Clinch NL West Title With Dominant Performance Over San Francisco Giants</h1><p>The LA Dodgers have clinched the NL West title with a dominant performance over the San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p> ace Clayton Kershaw led the WAY, pitching eight innings of one-run ball while striking out 10 batters. This was his 16th victory of the season and he lowered his ERA to 2.71.</p>
<p> Justin Turner and Cody Bellinger each homered for the Dodgers, who have now won six consecutive games.</p>
<p>The Giants were held to just three hits in the game and they remain in last place in the NL West division.</p>
<p>The Dodgers will now turn their attention to the playoffs, where they will be one of the favorites to win the World Series.</p>
<h1 id="Kenta-Maeda-Pitches-Gem-As-Dodgers-Rout-Giants-10-2"><a href="#Kenta-Maeda-Pitches-Gem-As-Dodgers-Rout-Giants-10-2" class="headerlink" title="Kenta Maeda Pitches Gem As Dodgers Rout Giants, 10-2"></a>Kenta Maeda Pitches Gem As Dodgers Rout Giants, 10-2</h1><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers welcomed the San Francisco Giants to town on Tuesday night, and Kenta Maeda was absolutely dealing. The Giants just didn’t have an answer for him.</p>
<p>Maeda pitched seven shutout innings, allowing just three hits and striking out nine batters. Not a bad way to ring in your 28th birthday.</p>
<p>“Kenta was fantastic tonight,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. “He had all of his pitches working, he was executing them and he had good tempo.”</p>
<p>The Dodgers offense did its part as well, scoring 10 runs on 16 hits. Justin Turner led the way with three hits, including a home run, while Cody Bellinger and Joc Pederson both added two RBIs.</p>
<p>With the win, the Dodgers moved into first place in the National League West, one game ahead of the Colorado Rockies. They’ll look to stay there with another win against the Giants on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="Justin-Turner-Hits-Two-Homers-In-Dodgers-Route-Of-Giants"><a href="#Justin-Turner-Hits-Two-Homers-In-Dodgers-Route-Of-Giants" class="headerlink" title="Justin Turner Hits Two Homers In Dodgers Route Of Giants"></a>Justin Turner Hits Two Homers In Dodgers Route Of Giants</h1><p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner hit two home runs Wednesday night against the San Francisco Giants. The first was a solo shot in the fifth inning and the second was a three-run homer in the seventh inning. This helped propel the Dodgers to an easy 10-2 victory.</p>
<p>Turner now has 18 homers this season, which leads the team. He is also batting .321, which is currently third best in the National League. Turner’s hot bat has been instrumental in the Dodgers recent success, as they have now won six of their last seven games.</p>
<p>“I’ve been feeling pretty good lately,” Turner said after Wednesday night’s game. “The biggest thing for me right now is just trying to get on base and let the big guys behind me do their thing.”</p>
<p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts agrees that Turner is playing extremely well right now.</p>
<p>“He’s been really good all year long and he’s carrying us right now,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>The Dodgers will need Turner to keep swinging a hot bat if they want to make a deep playoff run this season. They are currently in first place in the National League West division, but there is still a lot of baseball left to be played.</p>
<h1 id="Yasiel-Puig-Leads-Dodgers-Past-Giants-With-Three-RBIs"><a href="#Yasiel-Puig-Leads-Dodgers-Past-Giants-With-Three-RBIs" class="headerlink" title="Yasiel Puig Leads Dodgers Past Giants With Three RBIs"></a>Yasiel Puig Leads Dodgers Past Giants With Three RBIs</h1><p>LOS ANGELES — Yasiel Puig homered and drove in three runs,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> leading the Los Angeles Dodgers over the San Francisco Giants 4-2 on Saturday.</p>
<p>Puig connected for his eighth homer in 22 games this season, a two-run drive in the third inning against Derek Holland (1-4). He singled in the fifth and came around on Max Muncy’s sacrifice fly.</p>
<p>The Giants have lost four of five. Holland was chased in the fourth after allowing four runs and seven hits.</p>
<p>Kenley Jansen pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save.</p>
<p>Dodgers starter Ross Stripling allowed two runs and four hits in five innings. He struck out six and walked one.</p>
<p>Brandon Belt hit an RBI double in the first inning and Andrew McCutchen had an RBI single in the fourth for San Francisco.</p>
<h1 id="Cody-Bellinger-Notches-Four-Hits-As-LA-Dodgers-Hammer-San-Francisco-Giants"><a href="#Cody-Bellinger-Notches-Four-Hits-As-LA-Dodgers-Hammer-San-Francisco-Giants" class="headerlink" title="Cody Bellinger Notches Four Hits As LA Dodgers Hammer San Francisco Giants"></a>Cody Bellinger Notches Four Hits As LA Dodgers Hammer San Francisco Giants</h1><p>Cody Bellinger had himself a game on Wednesday night against the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers young slugger went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles and two RBIs in LA’s 14-2 thrashing of their NL West rivals.</p>
<p>Bellinger has now hit safely in six of his last seven games, raising his batting average from .284 to .311 in that span. The 22-year-old is quickly establishing himself as one of the premier hitters in all of baseball and could very well be in for a monster season.</p>
<p>The Dodgers offense was clicking on all cylinders against the Giants, pounding out 16 hits overall. Max Muncy, Yasiel Puig, Joc Pederson and Enrique Hernandez also drove in runs for LA.</p>
<p>Dodgers starter Rich Hill pitched six innings of one-run ball, striking out seven while only allowing three hits. This was a much needed bounce back outing for Hill, who had allowed 11 runs over his previous 9 2/3 innings pitched.</p>
<p>With the win, the Dodgers move to within 1 1/2 games of the first place Giants in the NL West standings. They’ll look to keep the pressure on their rivals with another win on Thursday night behind ace Clayton Kershaw.</p>
