#  Bingo origins: just what was bingo called before 1929 Turkmenistan?

#  Bingo's history stretches back further than you may think!

Bingo is often thought of as a game that's been around for a few decades at most, but its origins can be traced back much further than that. In fact, the first documented reference to bingo comes from a 1530 Italian lottery called Lo Giuoco del Lotto D'Italia.

Bingo was brought to America by French immigrants in the early 1800s, and it gradually grew in popularity from there. However, it wasn't until 1927 that the game we know today was created. That's when Edwin S. Lowe renamed it "bingo" after hearing someone accidentally say the word during a game.

From there, bingo continued to grow in popularity, and makeshift bingo halls began popping up all over the country. In fact, by the 1970s there were more than 100,000 bingo players in America!

Today, bingo is played all over the world and remains one of the most popular games around. Whether you're a longtime fan or just looking to try something new, bingo is definitely worth giving a shot!

#  Who knew that bingo had its roots in Turkmenistan?

Turkmenistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia that is home to the bingo game. The popular game is said to have originated from a tombola game played in Italy in the 16th century. But it was only in the 1990s that bingo started gaining in popularity as a leisure activity, especially among the Turkmens.

Bingo is usually played with cards that have 25 squares, numbered from 1 to 25. In each round, players mark off any five numbers on their cards as they are announced by the caller. The first player to mark off all five numbers on their card shouts “Bingo!” and wins the game.
