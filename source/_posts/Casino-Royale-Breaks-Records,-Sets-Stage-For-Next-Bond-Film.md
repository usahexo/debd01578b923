#  Casino Royale Breaks Records, Sets Stage For Next Bond Film

"Casino Royale", the twenty-first James Bond film, premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on Tuesday and has already set box office records. The film, which stars Daniel Craig as the new Bond and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, made 5.5 million pounds in its first day of release in the United Kingdom, breaking the record set by "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring".

In North America, "Casino Royale" grossed over 41 million dollars its opening weekend, becoming the number one film in the country and setting a new record for Sony Pictures Entertainment. The previous record holder was "Spider-Man 3".

"Casino Royale" is also doing well internationally. It took in an estimated 104 million dollars worldwide in its first five days, making it one of Sony's most successful openings ever.

The strong box office performance is good news for MGM and Sony Pictures, which are jointly producing the next Bond movie. Producers have been struggling to get the project financed due to concerns about the high budget. With "Casino Royale" doing well at the box office, they are now likely to have no trouble raising money for the next film.

Craig has already signed on to play Bond in two more movies, so we can expect to see more of him on the big screen in the future. As for Green, she is expected to reprise her role as Vesper Lynd in the next Bond movie.

#  Daniel Craig To Return As James Bond In Next Bond Movie

After much speculation on who will take up the mantle of 007 after Daniel Craig, it has been confirmed that Craig himself will return to play James Bond in the next movie installment, set for release in 2019.

This confirmation comes as a surprise to many, as Craig previously stated that he would rather "slash his wrists" than do another Bond movie. In an interview with Time Out London, Craig elaborated on his change of heart, stating: "I always said that I’d stop doing Bond if I felt like I was going to stop enjoying it... And ‘Spectre’ was pretty damn good. I loved it. It was a great ride."

Craig's return is sure to be welcomed by fans of the Bond series, who were dismayed by his comments indicating that he would not reprise the role. The upcoming movie is rumored to be based on the novel "Never Dream of Dying", which follows Bond as he investigates the death of his wife.

In addition to Craig's return, it has also been announced that Danny Boyle will direct the movie. Boyle is known for films such as Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire and is sure to bring a new level of excitement and intrigue to the Bond series.

#  New Bond Film Announced; Titled Casino Royale

After months of speculation, Sony Pictures has announced that the next James Bond film will be titled Casino Royale. The new film is set to star Daniel Craig in the leading role and is scheduled for release in November 2006.

Casino Royale will be based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming, and will follow Bond as he takes on a mission to track down Le Chiffre, a powerful terrorist banker. The title also refers to a high stakes poker game which takes place in the movie.

Craig made his debut as Bond in the 2005 film Casino Royale, and has starred in other films such as Munich and Defiance. The British actor recently signed a deal with Sony Pictures that will see him appear in at least two more Bond films.

Casino Royale is being directed by Martin Campbell, who also helmed Goldeneye and The Mask of Zorro. The screenplay was written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade, who have worked on previous Bond films such as Die Another Day and Thunderball.

The cast of Casino Royale also includes Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen and Judi Dench.

#  Official Announcement For Next James Bond Film Set

The producers of the James Bond franchise have officially announced that the next installment in the series will be released in 2020. The as-yet untitled film will see Daniel Craig return for his fifth and final appearance as 007.

In a statement, producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson said: "We are delighted to announce that Daniel Craig will play James Bond again! We begin production in December and we are excited to share some more details with you soon. But until then, we are keeping #Bond25 under wraps!"

This will be the 25th official James Bond film, and it's set to hit theaters on November 8th, 2020.

#  Production Begins On Next James Bond Film

After much speculation and rumor, it has been confirmed that production on the next James Bond film has begun. The 25th installment in the long-running spy franchise is set for release in November 2019 and will star Daniel Craig in his fifth and final outing as Agent 007.

Details on the plot are being kept under wraps, but producers have promised that it will be a "return to basics" for the series, with a focus on stunts, action and suspense over eye-popping set pieces and CGI effects. Craig himself has hinted that the film will be darker and more emotional than previous entries, with Bond struggling to come to terms with his past.

As usual, there is no shortage of suspects when it comes to potential villains, with recent reports linking Christoph Waltz's Blofeld to the new movie. Other cast members include Léa Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris.

So far there's been no word on who will be scoring the soundtrack, but given how iconic some of the earlier themes are (Goldfinger! Live and Let Die! etc.), it's sure to be one of the most eagerly awaited announcements of next year. In the meantime, fans can mark their calendars for November 8th 2019 and prepare for another wild ride with James Bond.
