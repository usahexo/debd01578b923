#  Unlimited blackjack: can benicio del toro really beat the house?

Can Benicio del Toro really beat the house at blackjack? The experts say that it’s theoretically possible, but in practice it’s very difficult.

The basis of blackjack is that the player has a better chance of winning than the house. This is because the player can see all of the cards, while the dealer only sees one – the one face-up on the table. The basic strategy for playing blackjack is to make decisions based on what you know about the cards that have already been played.

In order to have any chance of beating the house, you need to be able to count cards. This is a skill that can be learned, but it takes a lot of practice to become proficient at it. Even if you are a card counting expert, there is no guarantee that you will win every game – especially if you are up against a skilled dealer.

Benicio del Toro may be a talented actor, but he is not likely to beat the house at blackjack. If you want to have any chance of winning, you need to learn how to count cards and practise regularly.
