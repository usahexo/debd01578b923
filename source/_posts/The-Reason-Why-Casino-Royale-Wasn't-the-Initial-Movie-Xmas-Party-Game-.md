#  The Reason Why Casino Royale Wasn't the Initial Movie Xmas Party Game 

A Minor Casino Royale film mistake happened on December 14th, 2006. The party game Mix and Mingle wasn't the initial movie chosen to celebrate the Christmas season for the cast and crew of Casino Royale as initially planned. Instead, It was Funny Girl that was first screened in its place.
An individual who was working on the production team of Casino Royale said it had something to do with "a legal issue" but refused to elaborate any further on the situation. 
Ironically, MGM executives were so impressed with the dailies for Funny Girl they decided to delay Casino Royale and give the Barbra Streisand musical a prime holiday spot instead.
Streisand's movie went on to gross $138 million at the domestic box office while Casino Royale finished its theatrical run with a much lower $47 million.

#  How Casino Royale Became the Movie Xmas Party Game 

Casino Royale is a classic movie that has been enjoyed by many over the years. But what you may not know is that it almost didn't become the iconic film that we all know and love today.

It was actually Dan Gelfand, a producer for CBS, who came up with the idea to turn Casino Royale into a movie party game. He pitched the idea to his boss, but it was met with some initial skepticism. After all, who wanted to watch a movie where people just sat around playing cards?

However, Gelfand was able to convince his boss and Casino Royale was born. The movie was released in 1967 and became an instant hit. It's now considered to be one of the best James Bond movies of all time.
